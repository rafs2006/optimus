"""Composition test for ``OPTIMUS_MODE=simple``.

This boots the *real* :class:`~optimus.app.simple.SimpleApp` — the in-process
bus, the in-memory store, a temp-file SQLite brought up by the real
``run_migrations`` (alembic upgrade head), and every service wired exactly as a
live simple-mode process would wire them. The only doubles are the Discord edges
that need a network: a recording REST (so we can assert the enforcement actions)
and a fake image fetcher (so ingest does not hit the network). No NATS, no Redis,
no Postgres.

A synthetic ``message_image.v1`` event — what the gateway publishes for one
attachment — is put on the bus, and we assert it flows the whole pipeline
(ingest fetches -> detection matches the registered scam hash -> verdict ->
moderation bans the uploader) and then that the app shuts down cleanly.
