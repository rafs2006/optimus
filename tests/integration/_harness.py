"""Shared scaffolding for the in-process detection->moderation integration tests.

These helpers wire the *real* detection and moderation components together with
fake-but-faithful edges: an in-memory event bus that dispatches synchronously
(no NATS, no sleeps), a recording Discord REST double implementing the executor's
:class:`~optimus.services.moderation.actions.RestActions` surface, and a
fakeredis-backed Redis. The database is a real aiosqlite engine with the full
schema, exercised through the production repositories.
