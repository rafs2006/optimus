"""Single-process composition: every service in one asyncio process.

``OPTIMUS_MODE=simple`` runs Optimus with **zero external services** — no NATS,
no Redis, no Postgres. The six service runtimes that are normally separate
processes wired over JetStream are instead composed here over the
:class:`~optimus.bus.inprocess.InProcessBus`, sharing one SQLite engine, one
in-memory key/value store (:class:`~optimus.app.memory.MemoryStore`), and one
in-process rate limiter. The detection core and every service's logic are
untouched; this module only *composes* them.

The composition splits cleanly in two:

* The **bus pipeline** — ingest, detection, moderation, and the scheduler — needs
  no live Discord connection. It is wired by :meth:`SimpleApp.build` and is what
  the composition test drives by publishing a synthetic image event.
* The **Discord edges** — the gateway (inbound messages) and interactions
  (slash commands / buttons) — need a real gateway connection and are started by
  :meth:`SimpleApp.run`. The moderation REST client is likewise a real Discord
  edge, built lazily at run time (or injected by a test).

Durability note: the in-process bus keeps queued-but-unprocessed messages only in
memory, so a restart in simple mode loses anything still in flight. Run
``OPTIMUS_MODE=distributed`` when at-least-once durability across restarts
matters.
