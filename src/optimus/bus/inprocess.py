"""In-process event bus: asyncio queues standing in for NATS JetStream.

This is the transport behind ``OPTIMUS_MODE=simple``. It satisfies the same
:class:`~optimus.bus.Bus` surface as :class:`~optimus.bus.nats.EventBus` but
keeps everything in one process: each ``(subject, durable)`` consumer owns a
bounded :class:`asyncio.Queue`, and :meth:`publish` fans an event out to every
durable subscribed to the subject. It deliberately mirrors three JetStream
behaviours the pipeline relies on:

* **Publish dedup** — a repeated ``Nats-Msg-Id`` (the ``msg_id`` argument) within
  a sliding window is dropped before fan-out, so a handler that re-runs after a
  redelivery cannot fan a duplicate to every consumer.
* **Bounded in-flight** — each consumer processes at most ``max_inflight``
  messages concurrently (reusing ``detection_max_inflight`` semantics); the queue
  is sized to the same bound so a slow handler applies back-pressure to the
  publisher rather than ballooning memory.
* **Redelivery + poison-drop** — a handler that raises is retried up to
  ``max_deliver`` times, then the message is dropped (counted), matching the
  JetStream nak/redeliver/term path.

What it intentionally does **not** do is persist anything: messages live only in
memory, so a restart loses any messages that were queued but not yet processed.
That is an accepted trade-off for the zero-dependency single-process mode; run
``OPTIMUS_MODE=distributed`` (NATS JetStream) when durability matters.
