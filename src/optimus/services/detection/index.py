"""In-memory hash indexes (multi-index hashing) for guild-local and global scam hashes.

Each guild gets a lazily-built phash index keyed to its rows; a single global
index holds promoted cross-guild hashes. The full hash set for each matched
payload is retained so the ensemble can vote across all four hashes after the
phash index narrows candidates. Indexes rebuild from Postgres on boot and on
demand when an invalidation arrives.

The phash index is :class:`~optimus.hashing.mih.MultiIndexHash` (MIH): exact
Hamming-radius lookup that stays sub-linear at the production candidate radius 18,
where a BK-tree degrades toward a linear scan (see docs/capacity.md). Its results
are identical to a linear scan, so matcher semantics are unchanged.
