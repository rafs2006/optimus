"""Moderation orchestration: verdict -> policy -> boundaries -> action -> audit.

The coordinator ties the pure pieces (:mod:`policy`, :mod:`boundaries`) to the
side-effecting ones (:class:`~optimus.services.moderation.actions.ActionExecutor`,
report posting, audit recording) behind injected callables so the whole flow is
testable without a live gateway or database.
