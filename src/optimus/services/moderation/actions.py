"""Execution of moderation actions against Discord, guarded for safety.

Every punitive action flows through :class:`ActionExecutor`, which layers four
protections over the raw Discord REST calls:

* a **per-guild token bucket** so a noisy guild cannot exhaust the global rate;
* a **circuit breaker** that fails fast when Discord is unhealthy;
* **exponential backoff with jitter** on transient REST failures;
* an **idempotency key** recorded per ``(guild, message, action)`` so a
  redelivered verdict never double-bans.

The Discord surface is abstracted behind :class:`RestActions` so the executor is
testable without a live gateway. DM warnings are rate-limited per user via a
:class:`~optimus.services.moderation.cooldown.Cooldown`.
