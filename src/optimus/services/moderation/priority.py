"""Priority-aware dispatch for moderation work under REST rate-limit pressure.

During a raid, Discord REST rate limits and the per-guild token bucket throttle
the action path. Without prioritization, a protective action (delete a scam
message, timeout/ban the attacker) can queue behind low-urgency work (appeal
DMs, audit messages, notifications) and arrive too late to matter.

:class:`PriorityDispatcher` is a single-replica, in-process scheduler that runs
submitted coroutines under a bounded concurrency budget, always picking the
highest-priority ready item first and preserving FIFO order within a class.

Three properties make it safe to drop in front of the existing executor:

* **Priority + FIFO.** An :class:`asyncio.PriorityQueue` orders items by
  ``(effective_priority, sequence)``. ``sequence`` is a monotonic counter so
  ties within a class drain first-in-first-out (heapq is not stable on its own).
* **Starvation guard via aging.** A purely strict priority order would let a
  sustained flood of PROTECT work starve NOTIFY/COURTESY indefinitely. Each
  item's *effective* priority improves the longer it waits (one class level per
  ``aging_seconds``), so an old COURTESY item eventually outranks a fresh
  PROTECT one and low-priority work always drains. Aging (rather than a reserved
  worker share) keeps the common case — strict priority — exact, and only bends
  it under sustained pressure, which is precisely when fairness matters.
* **Bounded queue with a fail-safe drop policy.** The queue is capacity-capped.
  When full, COURTESY (and then NOTIFY) submissions are rejected with a
  reason-labeled metric rather than growing memory without bound; **PROTECT is
  never dropped** — protective work is admitted even past the cap, because
  losing it is worse than a transient overshoot.

Multi-replica note: each replica runs its own dispatcher over the work *it*
consumes from JetStream. There is no cross-replica priority coordination and
none is needed — JetStream already balances delivery across replicas, and every
replica independently prioritizing its own queue means the fleet as a whole
favours protective work without any shared state or distributed lock. The Redis
token bucket (see :class:`~optimus.core.ratelimit.RedisRateLimiter`) remains the
only cross-replica throttle; this dispatcher only orders a single replica's
already-admitted work.
