"""Run the real detection pipeline over a synthetic corpus and score it.

The harness exercises the production code paths end to end: it computes the four
perceptual hashes (:mod:`optimus.hashing.perceptual`), seeds a BK-tree
:class:`~optimus.services.detection.index.HashIndex` from the campaign bases,
gathers candidates by phash Hamming radius, and scores each candidate with the
real ensemble (:func:`optimus.hashing.ensemble.compare`).

To measure threshold behavior independently of the three fixed sensitivity
presets, the harness records the *minimum ensemble score* each image achieves
against the index (the score the matcher would act on) and then applies a sweep
of raw match thresholds. A lower score means a closer match, so an image is
"flagged" at threshold ``t`` when its best score ``<= t``. The same scores are
also bucketed against the configured presets so the report can recommend an
operating point relative to the shipped default.
